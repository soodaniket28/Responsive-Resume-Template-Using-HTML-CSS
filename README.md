# Responsive-Resume-Template-Using-HTML-CSS

This is my first Front-End Web Development project. It's been a month since I started Web-Development and tried to do my best in this project! <br />
The web page is responsive. It adapts according to the screen size.
Currently it's made only for a computer screen! <br />
Except Me.jpeg, all the photos used in the resume have been uploaded!

Refer to this video to check out what this Resume looks like on browser.
